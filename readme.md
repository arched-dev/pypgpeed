## Usage

To begin communicating via PGP you will need a private and a public key, this software enforces that you have a
passphrase attached to your private key for extra security.

If you do not have a set of keys. Please start by clicking  `file >> Generate New Keys` and follow the instructions to
generate the PGP keys you will need.

If you already have a set of keys, you can either enter the plaintext into the relevant boxes where needed, or autoload
them by choosing their containing directory with `file >> Set Key Location`, please beware that they must be
called `pri_key.key` and `pub_key.key`  

The rest is self explanatory...
